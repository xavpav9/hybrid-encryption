# RSA & AES

Basic RSA and AES hybrid encryption.

### Credits:
- Amazing video from [JacksonInfoSec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFXgbEL7DhI) on the calculation of the S-Box - I still barely understand it but this video helped the most.
- All the WikiPedia pages about this are great as well, specifically the ones on the [AES S-Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box) and many of the other pages about the steps of AES.
- Information for RSA implementation was mostly found on links from [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@curiosity-papers/carmichael-function-a-complete-guide-number-theory-1626d6b897f0)
- Very useful [animation](https://formaestudio.com/rijndaelinspector/archivos/Rijndael_Animation_v4_eng-html5.html).
- What I based the [handshake](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/) off of.
